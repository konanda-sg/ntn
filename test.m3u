Directed by Ivy Meeropol, the film examines Cohn\u2019s life as chief counsel to Senator Joseph McCarthy in the late 1950s and then through the 1980s when he became a darling of the Reagan White House, a rabid anti-homosexuality activist and political mentor to Donald Trump before dying from AIDS in 1986.
